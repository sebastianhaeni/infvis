# InfVis - Information Visualization

Information Visualization of a large source code base

## Abstract

The world becomes more and more driven by software. Thera are a lot of huge software intensive systems which have to be maintained and extended. A software intensive system is a special product. The single material it is made of, is source code. Therefore it exists only virtually. Often dozens of developers work on a system and it is difficult to keep track of it. Which components are regularly adapted? What should quality assurance focus on? In which areas should technical debt be reduced?

This project aims to visualize development activities, applied to the source code of a software intensive system, over time. To achieve this goal, the VCS history (git) will be mined to extract file manipulations. As a large source code bases contains thousands to millions of files, they are aggregated on the file system level (directory structure). To enable further drilldown, into an interesting aggregate, a treemap will be provided.

The following tools will be used:

* VCS mining: C#, .NET Framework, libgit2sharp
* Visualization: JavaScript, D3.js

## Project Plan

### Deadlines

* Abstract submission by March 13, 2019
* Project submission by May 15, 2019

### Project Collaborators

* Sebastian HÃ¤ni
* Marc Sallin

### Results

1. a poster of size A3 with two chart display
2. an interactive web based chart

### Activities

**TODO**


## Technical Concept

This chapther covers the technical details of the solution.

### VCS Mining

**TODO**

### Data preperation

**TODO**

### Activity Map

Treemap with Heatmap and Time series

<http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/treemap.html>

The goal is to visualize the source code how it grows over time (using commit data).
The files are highlighted in a heatmap fashion by amount of lines changes within the time slot chosen.
The treemap display top level folders (to a defined sub folder level), the size is respective to the amount of lines of code.
The folders are grouped by their parent folder and colorized.

This chart will

1. be interactable on web page by allowing the viewer to scroll through time using a slider or an automated playlist
2. be displayed on a poster with several small multiples

### Aggregate Drilldown

Radian dendrogram

Displays the folder structure / tree structure in an interesting way that allows the viewer to kinda dive into folders.
